The Bluetooth section of Tasmota currently consists of 2 driver classes, which, not least due to hardware restrictions, cannot be used together.  
On the one hand there is support for the use of "iBeacons" on some modules of the HM-1x family and on ESP32 internal Bluetooth.  
The second part consists of 3 drivers that can read the data from BLE sensors from the relatively diverse Xiaomi universe. These drivers offer very basic beacon functionality too.  
  
!!! info "Presence detection with iBeacons or BLE sensor gateway using HM-1x or nRF24L01(+) peripherals"

## iBeacon  

!!! info "This feature is included only in tasmota-sensors.bin"
Otherwise you must [compile your build](Compile-your-build). Add the following to `user_config_override.h`:

```
#ifndef USE_IBEACON
#define USE_IBEACON          // Add support for bluetooth LE passive scan of ibeacon devices 
#endif
```
  
Tasmota uses a BLE 4.x module to scan for [iBeacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon) devices. This driver is working with [HM-10 and clones](HM-10) and [HM16/HM17](HM-17) Bluetooth modules and potentially with other HM-1x modules depending on firmware capabilities.

### Using ESP32 built-in Bluetooth

You must [compile your build](Compile-your-build) for the ESP32 (since v9.1). Change the following to `user_config_override.h`:

```
#ifdef ESP32
  #define USE_IBEACON_ESP32    // Use internal ESP32 Bluetooth module
#endif // ESP32
```

### Features
For a list of all available commands see [Sensor52](Commands.md#sensor52) command.  

This driver reports all beacons found during a scan with its ID (derived from beacon's MAC address) prefixed with `IBEACON_` and RSSI value.

Every beacon report is published as an MQTT tele/%topic%/SENSOR in a separate message:

```json
tele/ibeacon/SENSOR = {"Time":"2020-03-24T20:09:40","IBEACON_FF34C21G2174":{"RSSI":-81}}
tele/ibeacon/SENSOR = {"Time":"2020-03-24T20:09:42","IBEACON_DEAABC788BC1":{"RSSI":-60}}
```

If the beacon can no longer be found during a scan and the timeout interval has passed the beacon's RSSI is set to zero (0) and it is no longer displayed in the webUI

```json
tele/ibeacon/SENSOR = {"Time":"2020-03-24T20:05:00","IBEACON_DEAABC788BC1":{"RSSI":-0}}
```

!!! tip
    When first connected some modules will be in peripheral mode. You have to change it to central mode using commands `Sensor52 1` and `Sensor52 2`.

!!! tip
    You can activate a beacon with a beeper using command `IBEACON_%BEACONID%_RSSI 99` (ID is visible in webUI and SENSOR reports). This command can freeze the Bluetooth module and beacon scanning will stop. After a reboot of Tasmota the beacon will start beeping and scanning will resume.
   
## Tasmota and BLE-sensors

Different vendors offer Bluetooth solutions as part of the XIAOMI family often under the MIJIA-brand (while AQUARA is the typical name for a ZigBee sensor).  
The sensors supported by Tasmota use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to transmit the sensor data, but they differ in their accessibilities quite substantially.  
  
Basically all of them use of so-called „MiBeacons“ which are BLE advertisement packets with a certain data structure, which are broadcasted by the devices automatically while the device is not in an active bluetooth connection.  
The frequency of these messages is set by the vendor and ranges from one per 3 seconds to one per hour (for the battery status of the LYWSD03MMC). Motion sensors and BLE remote controls start to send when an event is triggered.  
These packets already contain the sensor data and can be passively received by other devices and will be published regardless if a user decides to read out the sensors via connections or not. Thus the battery life of a BLE sensor is not influenced by reading these advertisements and the big advantage is the power efficiency as no active bi-directional connection has to be established. The other advantage is, that scanning for BLE advertisements can happen nearly parallel (= very quick one after the other), while a direct connection must be established for at least a few seconds and will then block both involved devices for that time.  
This is therefore the preferred option, if technically possible (= for the supported sensors).
  
Most of the „older“ BLE-sensor-devices use unencrypted messages, which can be read by all kinds of BLE-devices or even a NRF24L01. With the arrival of "newer" sensors came the problem of encrypted data in MiBeacons, which can be decrypted in Tasmota (not yet with the HM-1x).  
Meanwhile it is possible to get the needed "bind_key" with the help of an open-source project: <https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html>.
At least the LYWSD03 allows the use of a simple BLE connection without any encrypted authentication and the reading of the sensor data using normal subscription methods to GATT-services (currently used on the HM-1x). This is more power hungry than the passive reading of BLE advertisements.  
Other sensors like the MJYD2S are not usable without the "bind_key".  
  
### Supported Devices

!!! note "It can not be ruled out, that changes in the device firmware may break the functionality of this driver completely!"  

The naming conventions in the product range of bluetooth sensors in XIAOMI-universe can be a bit confusing. The exact same sensor can be advertised under slightly different names depending on the seller (Mijia, Xiaomi, Cleargrass, ...).

passive: data is received via BLE advertisements

#### Devices with payload encryption  
  
The LYWSD03MMC, MHO-C401 and the MJYD2S will start to send advertisements with encrypted sensor data after pairing it with the official Xiaomi app. Out-of-the-box the sensors do only publish a static advertisement.  
It is possible to do a pairing and get the necessary decryption key ("bind_key") here: <https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html>.
This project also provides a custom firmware for the LYWSD03MMC, which then becomes an ATC and is supported by Tasmota too. Default ATC-setting will drain the battery more than stock firmware, because of very frequent data sending.  
This key and the corresponding MAC of the sensor can be injected with the NRFKEY-command (or NRFMJYD2S). It is probably a good idea to save the whole config as RULE like that:  
  
```haskell
rule1 on System#Boot do backlog NRFkey 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566; NRFkey 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566; NRFPage 6; NRFUse 0; NRFUse 4 endon
```  
(key for two sensors, 6 sensors per page in the WebUI, turn off all sensors, turn on LYWS03)  
  
LYWSD03MMC sends encrypted sensor data every 10 minutes. As there are no confirmed reports about correct battery presentation of the sensor (always shows 99%), this function is currently not supported.  
MJYD2S sends motion detection events and 2 discrete illuminance levels (1 lux or 100 lux for a dark or bright environment). Additionally battery level and contiguous time without motion in discrete growing steps (no motion time = NMT).    
 
  
#### Working principle of Tasmota BLE drivers (>8.5.)
  
The idea is to provide drivers with as many automatic functions as possible. Besides the hardware setup, there are zero or very few things to configure.  
The sensor namings are based on the original sensor names and shortened if appropriate (Flower care -> Flora). A part of the MAC will be added to the name as a suffix.  
All sensors are treated as if they are physically connected to the ESP8266 device. For motion and remote control sensors MQTT-messages will be published in (nearly) real time.
The ESP32 and the HM-1x-modules are real BLE devices whereas the NRF24L01 (+) is only a generic 2.4 GHz transceiver with very limited capabilities.  
  
##### Options to read out the LYWSD03MMC  
  
1. Generate a bind_key  
The web-tool <https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html> allows the generation of a so-called bind_key by faking a pairing with the Xiaomi cloud. You can copy-paste this key and add the MAC to use this resultig key-MAC-string with key-command (NRFkey or MI32key). Then the driver will receive the sensors data roughly every 10 minutes (in two chunks for humidity and temperature with about a minute in between) and decode the data. This is the most energy efficient way. 
The current way of storing these keys on the ESP32 is to use RULES like that (for the NRF24L01 you would use NRFkey):  
```haskell
rule1 on System#Boot do backlog MI32key 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566; MI32key 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFFAABBCCDDEEFF endon
```  
This option is currently not available for the HM-10 because of memory considerations as part of the standard sensor-firmware package.  
  
2. Flash custom ATC-firmware  
Use the same <https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html> to flash a custom ATC-firmware on the LYWSD03MMC. This will work out of the box with all three Tasmota-drivers. There is a slight chance of bricking the sensor, which would require some soldering and compiling skills to un-brick. This firmware does send data more frequently and is a little bit more power hungry than the stock firmware.  
  
3. Use active connections  
By default on the HM-10 (for legacy reasons) and at compile-time selectable on the ESP32 is the method to connect to the sensor from time to time. This circumvents the data encryption. This is very power hungry and drains the battery fast. Thus it is only recommended as fallback mechanism.

  
## BLE Sensors using HM-1x

!!! info "This feature is included only in tasmota-sensors.bin"
Otherwise you must [compile your build](Compile-your-build). Add the following to `user_config_override.h`:

```
#ifndef USE_HM10
#define USE_HM10          // Add support for HM-10 as a BLE-bridge (+9k3 code)
#endif
```

### Features
Supported sensors will be connected to at a set interval (default interval equals TelePeriod). A subscription is established for 5 seconds and data (e.g. temperature, humidity and battery) is read and reported to an mqtt topic (Dew point is calculated):

```json
tele/%topic%/SENSOR = {"Time":"2020-03-24T12:47:51","LYWSD03-52680f":{"Temperature":21.1,"Humidity":58.0,"DewPoint":12.5,"Battery":100},"LYWSD02-a2fd09":{"Temperature":21.4,"Humidity":57.0,"DewPoint":12.5,"Battery":2},"MJ_HT_V1-d8799d":{"Temperature":21.4,"Humidity":54.6,"DewPoint":11.9},"TempUnit":"C"}
```

After a completed discovery scan, the driver will report the number of found sensors. As Tasmota can not know how many sensors are meant to be discovered you have to force a re-scan until the desired number of devices is found.
```haskell
Rule1 ON HM10#Found<6 DO Add1 1 ENDON ON Var1#State<=3 DO HM10Scan ENDON 
```
This will re-scan up to 3 times if less than 6 sensors are found.

## BLE Sensors using nRF24L01(+)

### Configuration
  
You must [compile your build](Compile-your-build). Change the following in `my_user_config.h`:

```arduino
// -- SPI sensors ---------------------------------
#define USE_SPI                                  // Hardware SPI using GPIO12(MISO), GPIO13(MOSI) and GPIO14(CLK) in addition to two user selectable GPIOs(CS and DC)
#ifdef USE_SPI
  #define USE_NRF24                              // Add SPI support for NRF24L01(+) (+2k6 code)
  #ifdef USE_NRF24
    #define USE_MIBLE                            // BLE-bridge for some Mijia-BLE-sensors (+4k7 code)
```

Sensors will be discriminated by using the Product-ID of the MiBeacon. A human readable short product name will be shown instead of the company-assigned ID of the BLE Public Device Address (= the "lower" 24 bits). 

A TELE message could like look this:  
  
```json
10:13:38 RSL: stat/tasmota/STATUS8 = {"StatusSNS":{"Time":"2019-12-18T10:13:38","Flora-6ab577":{"Temperature":21.7,"Illuminance":21,"Humidity":0,"Fertility":0},"MJ_HT_V1-3108be":{"Temperature":22.3,"Humidity":56.1},"TempUnit":"C"}}
```
  
As the NRF24L01 can only read BLE-advertisements, only the data in these advertisements is accessible.  
All sensors have an additional GATT-interface with more data in it, but it can not be read with a NRF24l01. 
  
As we can not use a checksum to test data integrity of the packet, only data of sensors whose addresses showed up more than once (default = 3 times) will be published.
Internally from time to time "fake" sensors will be created, when there was data corruption in the address bytes.  These will be removed automatically.

### Beacon  
  
A simplified presence dection will scan for regular BLE advertisements of a given BT-device defined by its MAC-address. It is important to know, that many new devices (nearly every Apple-device) will change its MAC every few minutes to prevent tracking.  
If the driver receives a packet from the "beacon" a counter will be (re-)started with an increment every second. This timer is published in the TELE-message, presented in the webUI and processed as a RULE.
The stability of regular readings will be strongly influenced by the local environment (many BLE-devices nearby or general noise in the 2.4-GHz-band). 

## BLE Sensors on ESP32 using built-in Bluetooth

Since Tasmota v9.1.0.1 this driver is part of the standard build 'tasmota32'. It must be enabled at runtime via `setoption115 1`. 
  
To turn on/off support for decyrption, change the following in the driver code:  

```haskell
#define USE_MI_DECRYPTION
```  
Without encryption support the driver will read data from found LYWSD03MMC via connection. This will increase power consumption of the sensor, but no "bind_key" is needed.  

The driver will start to scan for known sensors automatically using a hybrid approach, when encryption support is deactivated. In the first place MiBeacons are passively received and only found LYWSD03MMC- and MHO-C401-sensors will be connected at the given period to read data in order to be as energy efficient as possible.
Battery data is in general of questionable value for the LYWSD0x, CGD1, MHO-C401 and (maybe) Flora (some are even hard coded on the device to 99%). That's why only MJ_HT_V1, CGG1 (untested) and LYWSD03 (calculated battery level) will automatically update battery data. The other battery levels can be read by command. 
The internally very similar LYWS03MMC and MHO-C401 behave very confusing in delivering battery status. Both report (fixed) 99% or 100% via encrypted payload or connected reading of the battery characteristic. But they can deliver a correct battery voltage in their payload of the temperature and humidity data, which will be mapped to a percentage level by the driver.

!!! tip 
If you really want to read battery for LYWSD02, Flora and CGD1, consider doing it once a day with a RULE:
`RULE1 on Time#Minute=30 do MI32Battery endon`
This will update every day at 00:30 AM.  
  
   
### Beacon  
  
A count-up-timer starts for every beacon a  with every received advertisement, starting with 0.  
  
TELE-output:  
`"Beacon1":{"MAC":"11:22:33:44:55:66","CID":"0x0000","SVC":"0x0000","UUID":"0x0000","Time":4,"RSSI":0}}`  
  
RULE-example:  
`on Beacon2#time==30 do SOMETHING endon` - is triggered 30 seconds after last packet was received  
`on system#boot do MI32Beacon2 AABBCCDDEEFF endon` - save configuration for beacon 2 
  
  
(following AD type, read here: <https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/generic-access-profile/>)  
CID - company identifier  
SVC - service data  
UUID - service or class UUID
